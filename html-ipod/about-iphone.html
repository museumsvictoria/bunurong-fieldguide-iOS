        <p>This Field Guide app portrays the rich marine life found in Bunurong Marine National Park and nearby waters, in South Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. It presents imagery and descriptions of over 300 marine animal and plant species, with over half represented by images taken within the park boundaries. Over 700 marine species have been recorded from the park and this app presents those commonly encountered and others of special interest.</p>
		<p>The Field Guide is a product of the <em>Under the Lens</em> program, a Parks Victoria and Museum Victoria collaboration that aims to showcase Victoria's rich marine life and raise the profile of marine protected areas across Victoria. The <em>Under the Lens</em> program now supports the <em>Park Bioscans</em> program, a long-term collaborative partnership between Parks Victoria and Museum Victoria.</p>

It manages the state's 30 Marine Protected Areas, encompassing around 12% of Victoria's marine waters. The <em>Healthy Parks Healthy People</em> philosophy is central to all Parks Victoria activities, with the authority playing a lead role in connecting people and communities with parks and nature.</p>
		    <p>Museum Victoria is Australia's largest public museum organisation. It is responsible for Victoria's state reference and research collections, documenting Victoria's natural and cultural history, and providing public education and engagement programs at its three venues (Melbourne Museum, Scienceworks and the Immigration Museum), as well as offsite and online.</p>
